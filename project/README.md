# Automated Grading System

An AI-powered grading system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

This system enables automated grading of assignments and exams using AI technology while ensuring transparency and immutability through blockchain technology.

### Key Features

- Create and manage assignments with customizable grading criteria
- Secure submission system with deadline enforcement
- Automated grading using AI (to be implemented)
- Transparent and immutable grade records
- Appeal system for grade disputes (to be implemented)

## Smart Contract Architecture

The system consists of the following main components:

1. Assignment Management
   - Create and update assignments
   - Set grading criteria and deadlines
   - Define point distribution

2. Submission Handling
   - Accept student submissions
   - Validate submission deadlines
   - Store submission metadata

3. Grading System (To be implemented)
   - AI-based automated grading
   - Manual override capabilities
   - Appeal handling

## Development Setup

1. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @stacks/cli
   npm install -g clarinet
   ```

2. Initialize Project:
   ```bash
   clarinet new automated-grading-system
   cd automated-grading-system
   ```

3. Run Tests:
   ```bash
   clarinet test
   ```

## Security Considerations

- Access control mechanisms for administrative functions
- Deadline enforcement
- Data integrity checks
- Prevention of grade manipulation
- Secure storage of submission content hashes

## Testing

The project maintains a minimum of 50% test coverage, with tests covering:
- Assignment creation and management
- Submission handling
- Grading functionality
- Access control
- Error conditions
